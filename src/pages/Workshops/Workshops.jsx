              Workshops are intended for hands-on experiential learning in coming-of-age topics like
              cybersecurity and generative AI. They are designed and planned in such a way that
              they improve studentâ€™s critical thinking skills along with the technical takeaways. But
              that's not all, we believe a good break makes learning easier and one more focused,
              which is why we have a whole set of numerous games set up for the participants during
              the break and a catch-up session with the students of IIT-Hyderabad at the end of the
              workshops.
